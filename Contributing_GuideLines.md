<h1> Contributing Guidelines</h1>

Thank you for considering contributing to the **TechTroubleshootLog** repository! Here are a few guidelines to help you get started.

<h2> Issue Reporting</h2>

Please make sure to thoroughly search for a solution to your problem before creating a new issue. If you find a similar issue, please add a comment to it instead of creating a new one.

When creating an issue, please include the following information:

* A clear and concise description of the problem
* Steps to reproduce the issue
* Relevant log outputs and error messages
* The version of the software you're using
* Any additional context that might be helpful


<h2> Pull Request </h2>

We welcome pull requests that fix bugs, add new features, or improve documentation. If you're unsure whether your idea fits, feel free to open an issue to discuss it first.
Before submitting a pull request, make sure to:

* Write clear and concise commit messages that describe the changes you've made
* Test your changes thoroughly to ensure they don't break existing functionality
